//! Render the client's local `libghostty_vt::Terminal` to the outer
//! terminal as VT escape sequences.
//!
//! Under ADR-0013 the client owns one `Terminal` per attached pane;
//! `TERMINAL_OUTPUT` byte frames are fed into it via `vt_write`. This
//! module reads the resulting structured state back out via
//! `RenderState` (per-row dirty tracking) and emits VT to stdout.
//!
//! v0 emits a **dirty-row redraw**: for each row reported dirty by
//! `RenderState`, position the cursor at the row, then walk its cells
//! emitting an SGR sequence only when a cell's style differs from the one
//! currently active on the outer terminal (a run of same-style cells costs
//! one SGR plus the glyphs) and writing each cell's graphemes. Per-row dirty
//! bits are reset after the row is drawn so subsequent renders skip clean
//! rows.
//!
//! No raw-mode or alt-screen toggling happens here; the [`super::driver`]
//! owns those transitions via an RAII guard so they survive panics and
//! early returns.
//!
//! See `research/2026-05-25-libghostty-renderstate.md` for the
//! renderer-side contract this module implements.
